Ideas for fixing this 

1. Choose an easier problem lol

2. get rid of pooling. i think that might be rlly bad lol.

3. attention?

4. simpler state representation -- eg instead of feeding in the
   whole grid just feed in a little patch surrounding the
   character  -- oh that's kind of nice actually  and then i dont
   need to buy a gpu lol

5. let the agent remember its path.
for instance, the input could include the last couple places
where the guy has been or something
